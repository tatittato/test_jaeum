            # Task
            - The goal is to output sleep scores and comments for improving sleep quality.
            - Follow step by step below.

            ## Step 1
            - You will be provided with a sleep data delimited by triple quotes.

            ## Step 2
            - The recommended sleep start time is 10pm to 11pm
            - Refer to the 'start_sleep' field to create a one-line summary of sleep start_time advice in the output type '수면 시작 시간' field.

            ## Step 3
            - The recommended sleep time is 7-9 hours
            - Refer to the 'total_sleep' field to create a one-line summary of sleep total_time advice in the output type '총 수면 시간' field.

            ## Step 4
            - Please don't put "irrelevant label"
            - Refer to 'sleep_event' to create the sleep posture received in the output type '수면 자세' field.

             ## Step 5
            - Recommend bad sleep posture time for less than 20% of the total time
            - Refer to the 'bad_position_time' to create summary of the sleep posture advice received in the output type '바르지 않은 수면 자세 시간' field.
            

             ## Step 6
            - Refer to all fields in the Improvements field in the output format to provide detailed advice on improving sleep

            ## Good labels
            - standard

            ## Shrimp posture
            - The "shrimp" sleeping position involves a C-shaped back, straining the spine and muscles to bend to one side.
            - This posture shortens key muscles linking the lower spine and pelvis, potentially causing back pain.
            - It applies roughly three times more pressure on the back muscles compared to a proper sleeping position.

            ## hurray posture
            - Raising your arms while sleeping can lead to pressure on your neck, shoulders, and back, keeping your body in a tense state, causing an overall imbalance.
            - Tense muscles may compress blood vessels and nerves, potentially affecting blood circulation and causing symptoms like numbness in the nerves.
            - There's a risk of temporarily narrowed airways, potentially worsening snoring, and possibly leading to gastrointestinal issues like reflux esophagitis.

            ## prone posture
            - Sleeping on your stomach can strain the neck and spine.
            - It may increase pressure on the head and neck, potentially impacting blood circulation.
            - This position can lead to skin irritation, acne, and wrinkles due to contact with the pillow.
            - It shares similarities with the issues mentioned, like increased intraocular pressure and potential strain on the spine and neck.

            ## Legs crossed posture
            - Sleeping in a cross-legged position twists the spine and pelvis, disrupting the body's symmetry.
            - It causes shortening of the hamstrings, femoral muscles, and groin muscles.

            ## Side posture
            - Side sleeping can cause the spine to be improperly aligned, leading to potential discomfort and back or neck pain.
            - This position may create uncomfortable pressure points on the hips and shoulders, leading to soreness.
            - Side sleeping can contribute to wrinkles on one side of the face due to skin pressure.
            - It might worsen breathing and digestive problems such as acid reflux.
            - Regular side sleeping may contribute to breast sagging over time.
